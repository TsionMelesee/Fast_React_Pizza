# Fast_React_Pizza
This is a simple React app that displays a menu for a pizza company, showcasing different pizza options with their ingredients, prices, and availability. Users can place an order. Sold-out pizzas are marked accordingly, and the app dynamically shows whether the restaurant is open or closed based on the current time.
